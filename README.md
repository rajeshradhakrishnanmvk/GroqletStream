üöÄ **Building Real-Time AI Streaming with Agentic Patterns in ASP.NET Core: Introducing GroqletStream** üéâ

I‚Äôm thrilled to share **GroqletStream**, a new GitHub project built to implement **agentic patterns** for real-time AI streaming in **ASP.NET Core**. By combining GroqletStream with agentic patterns, we‚Äôre enabling developers to create smarter, more interactive applications capable of sophisticated response handling and real-time insights.

üîó **Agentic Patterns Repo:** [Agentic Patterns](https://github.com/neural-maze/agentic_patterns)

### üåê What is GroqletStream?

**GroqletStream** is a .NET Core streaming solution designed to leverage **IAsyncEnumerable** and deliver **real-time AI responses**. By implementing agentic patterns from the **Neural Maze** repository, developers can add intelligent behaviors, asynchronous decision-making, and response handling to their applications.

### üß† Why Use Agentic Patterns?

Agentic patterns enable more complex behaviors in AI-driven applications. With patterns such as **Action Matching**, **Pause and Resume**, and **Tool Execution**, your application gains a conversational and context-aware flow, making it more responsive and interactive.

### üîë Key Features of GroqletStream with Agentic Patterns

1. **Real-Time Data Streaming**: Incremental responses for faster feedback loops.
2. **Customizable Patterns**: Implement AI agents capable of decision-making with dynamic action handling.
3. **Scalable with .NET Core**: Optimized for handling real-time streaming in production settings.

### üìñ Getting Started

Here's a guide to integrate **agentic patterns** within GroqletStream for responsive and interactive AI agents.

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Clone the Repositories**

First, clone **GroqletStream** to set up the real-time streaming API, and then **Agentic Patterns** for implementing custom logic.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rajeshradhakrishnanmvk/GroqletStream.git
git clone https://github.com/neural-maze/agentic_patterns.git
```

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Configure the Streaming API in GroqletStream**

Set up a streaming endpoint that will use the agentic patterns to create a dynamic and interactive AI flow.

```csharp
app.MapPost("/api/agent/ask", async (HttpContext httpContext, GroqAgentRequest request) =>
{
    var agentService = httpContext.RequestServices.GetRequiredService<IGroqAgentService>() as GroqAgentService;

    httpContext.Response.ContentType = "text/plain";
    var cancellationToken = httpContext.RequestAborted;

    await foreach (var result in agentService.AskAgent(request.Query, cancellationToken))
    {
        await httpContext.Response.WriteAsync(result + "\n", cancellationToken);
        await httpContext.Response.Body.FlushAsync(cancellationToken);
    }
});
```

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Implement Agentic Patterns in `AskAgent`**

Here, `AskAgent` uses **Action Matching** and **Tool Execution** patterns to adapt responses based on recognized actions in the query. By integrating these patterns, the agent becomes more versatile and capable of understanding specific commands.

```csharp
public async IAsyncEnumerable<string> AskAgent(string query, [EnumeratorCancellation] CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)
{
    await foreach (var result in LoopAsync(query, cancellationToken: cancellationToken))
    {
        yield return result;
    }
}
```

#### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Define the Loop Using Agentic Patterns**

Inside `LoopAsync`, leverage patterns like **Pause and Resume** and **Action Matching**. This allows the agent to detect keywords such as "PAUSE" or specific actions, enhancing its decision-making abilities.

```csharp
public async IAsyncEnumerable<string> LoopAsync(
    string query, 
    int maxIterations = 5, 
    [EnumeratorCancellation] CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)
{
    var agent = new GroqAgent(_client, systemPrompt);
    var tools = new List<string> { "textual_analysis", "get_books_self" };
    var nextPrompt = query;

    while (!cancellationToken.IsCancellationRequested)
    {
        for (int i = 0; i < maxIterations; i++)
        {
            var result = await agent.CallAsync(nextPrompt);
            yield return result;

            if (result.Contains("PAUSE") && result.Contains("Action"))
            {
                var actionMatch = Regex.Match(result, @"Action: ([a-z_]+): (.+)", RegexOptions.IgnoreCase);
                if (actionMatch.Success)
                {
                    var chosenTool = actionMatch.Groups[1].Value;
                    var arg = actionMatch.Groups[2].Value;

                    if (tools.Contains(chosenTool))
                    {
                        var resultTool = await ExecuteToolAsync(chosenTool, arg);
                        nextPrompt = $"Observation: {resultTool}";
                    }
                    else
                    {
                        nextPrompt = "Observation: Tool not found";
                    }

                    yield return nextPrompt;
                    continue;
                }
            }

            if (result.Contains("Answer"))
            {
                yield break;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### ‚öôÔ∏è How Agentic Patterns Enhance GroqletStream

- **Action Matching**: Detects keywords to trigger specific behaviors, enabling real-time actions based on user commands.
- **Pause and Resume**: Adds flow control for conversation continuity, allowing the agent to adjust based on pauses or user prompts.
- **Tool Execution**: Dynamically executes tools or APIs based on the action needed, like analyzing data or fetching specific results.

### üîç **Real-World Use Case**

Imagine a **real-time financial assistant** that analyzes stock trends. Using GroqletStream with agentic patterns, the assistant could:

1. Stream real-time updates to the user without delay.
2. Respond to specific keywords or commands such as ‚ÄúPAUSE‚Äù when more data analysis is required.
3. Execute actions like ‚Äúget_stock_trend‚Äù to fetch relevant stock information and adapt responses based on the tool results.

This enables applications to become more context-aware and responsive, providing a seamless user experience.

### üíª **Conclusion**

Combining GroqletStream‚Äôs real-time streaming with **agentic patterns** introduces a new level of responsiveness and intelligence in .NET Core applications. With features like Action Matching and Pause and Resume, GroqletStream lets you build AI-driven applications that respond dynamically to user interactions.
